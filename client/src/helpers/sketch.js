/*

essential error if I cannot display the page
    - so far Dashboard, Crag/s, Profile, Social, User

What do I offer on that page?

toast for updating a field
    - uploader, edits, add Friends
    - could now also include a success

    
Error-log for notifications?

how do I deal with the chat?


essentials will stop the APP and not do anything - big screen - no parallel action
offering reload or logout after a potential Countdown

Essential Component will be displayed in the Component and offered a reload or redirect to Dashboard
